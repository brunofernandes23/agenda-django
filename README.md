# Schedule of events

## Agenda Project with Django

**_Start_**

> The project was started in Django, using _models.py_ added the event data and made the event listing functions, and through _django-admin_ registered different users.
 
**_Middle_**

> In the middle of the project, templates were made to use _urls_ and html files for adding, editing, updating and deleting events (CRUD), without the need to access _admin_, which allows for greater data security

**_Finishing_**

> In the end I was able to create a way to list the events using _JsonResponse_ and error handling was done with Http404.

**_Considerations_**

> The project was made by Digital Innovation One. By Rafael Galleani. I was able to learn the fundamentals and what is needed to use Django, and with that, acquire new knowledge about Python!

**_Enjoy_**
